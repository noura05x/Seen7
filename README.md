SEEN4 
=======

Seen4 is a Flutter-based personal safety application that connects vulnerable users with their emergency contacts through real-time SOS alerts, Bluetooth-connected hardware, live GPS tracking, and audio/visual evidence capture. The system is built around a custom ESP32 wearable device that allows users to trigger emergencies hands-free, even without touching their phone.

------------------------------------------------------------

THE PROBLEM IT SOLVES
=====================

People in vulnerable situations — whether due to age, disability, or personal safety risks — often cannot reach their phone in an emergency. Seen4 solves this by pairing a physical wearable device with a mobile app. A single press of the device's emergency button immediately alerts trusted contacts with the user's live location, recorded audio, and full incident details, all synced in real time through Firebase.

------------------------------------------------------------

HARDWARE — SEEN DEVICE
======================

The SEEN device is a custom-built wearable powered by an ESP32 microcontroller. It operates independently and communicates with the mobile app over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). When an emergency is triggered — either through the physical button or the app — the device begins capturing evidence and transmitting data immediately.

  Component  |  Purpose

  ESP32 Microcontroller  |  The brain of the device. Controls all components, manages BLE communication with the mobile app, and handles data transmission to Firebase.
  GPS Module  |  Tracks the user's real-time location and streams latitude/longitude coordinates to the app and Firestore during an active alert.
  Camera Module  |  Captures visual evidence (images/video) when an emergency is triggered, uploaded to Firebase Storage for emergency contacts and admins to review.
  Microphone  |  Records audio during an emergency. The recording is encoded in AAC format (128kbps, 44100Hz) and uploaded automatically to Firebase Storage under the alert's evidence folder.
  Emergency Button  |  A physical push button that triggers the SOS alert system without needing to open the app — critical for hands-free emergencies.
  Battery Module  |  Powers the entire device. Battery level is monitored and synced to the app via BLE so the user always knows the device's charge status.

BLE COMMUNICATION
=================

The ESP32 communicates with the Flutter app using the Nordic UART Service (NUS) BLE profile:

  UUID  |  Role

  6E400001-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E  |  NUS Service
  6E400002-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E  |  Command characteristic (app → device)
  6E400003-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E  |  Status/notify characteristic (device → app)

The app continuously listens to the device's status stream via SeenBleService and BleSyncService, syncing GPS coordinates, battery level, microphone status, and device state (Ready / Armed / Disarmed / Emergency) to Firestore in real time.

------------------------------------------------------------

MOBILE APP
==========

USER ROLES
==========

The app supports three distinct roles, each with a completely separate dashboard and navigation flow:

1. Vulnerable User
The person being protected. After signing up and pairing their SEEN device, they can:
- Monitor their paired device's connection status and battery level from the dashboard
- Trigger an SOS alert manually from the app (with a 5-second countdown to cancel)
- Receive SOS triggers from the physical device button automatically
- Add and manage emergency contacts (searched by email, stored with name and relation)
- View device location history and alert history
- Edit their profile, change language, and manage account settings

2. Emergency Contact
A trusted person linked to one or more vulnerable users. They can:
- View a real-time dashboard of all linked vulnerable users and their current status (Safe / Alert)
- Receive instant push notifications when a linked user triggers an SOS
- Open full alert detail pages showing location, audio recording link, timestamps, and alert status
- Acknowledge or resolve active alerts
- View the full alert history for each linked user
- Manage their own settings and notification preferences

3. Admin
A system administrator with full oversight. They can:
- View a live system overview: total users, active alerts, total devices, online/offline device counts
- Browse and manage all registered users (vulnerable users, emergency contacts)
- View all system alerts with full details and status
- Review problem reports submitted by users, with the ability to mark them as resolved
- Export incident reports as PDF documents
- Manage system-wide settings

------------------------------------------------------------

FEATURES
========

CORE SAFETY FEATURES
====================
- One-tap SOS — triggers from the app dashboard or the physical device button, with a 5-second cancellable countdown when triggered from the app
- Alert fan-out — when SOS fires, the system immediately notifies all linked emergency contacts by writing to their linkedUsers and alerts Firestore collections, and sends push notifications via Firebase Cloud Messaging
- Live GPS tracking — the ESP32's GPS module streams coordinates over BLE; BleSyncService writes them to Firestore in real time so emergency contacts can track the user's location during an incident
- Audio evidence recording — when an alert is triggered, EvidenceRecordingService starts recording audio immediately (AAC-LC, 128kbps, 44100Hz, mono) and uploads the file to Firebase Storage under evidence/{uid}/{alertId}/audio.m4a
- Camera evidence — the device's camera module captures visual evidence during an emergency, also uploaded to Firebase Storage

DEVICE FEATURES
===============
- BLE device pairing — scan for nearby SEEN devices, pair by device ID, and maintain an auto-reconnect connection in the background
- Device status monitoring — live connection state, battery percentage, armed/disarmed state, and safety status displayed on the dashboard
- Device history — view past device events and status changes

APP FEATURES
============
- Role-based routing — on login, the app reads the user's role from Firestore and routes them to the correct dashboard automatically
- Bilingual UI — full Arabic and English support with RTL layout switching, persisted across sessions via shared_preferences
- Profile management — users can update their name, phone, age, gender, and other profile fields
- Emergency contact management — vulnerable users add contacts by email; the app looks up the contact's UID in Firestore and links the accounts bidirectionally
- Help & support — in-app help page and problem reporting with submission to Firestore
- Terms & conditions — in-app terms page
- PDF export — admins can generate and print PDF incident reports using the pdf and printing packages
- Charts & analytics — admin dashboard uses fl_chart to visualize alert and user statistics
